### `AFC-FRP-CDS` MUST — Criticality Designators

FedRAMP MUST convey the criticality of the message in the subject line, IF the message requires an elevated reaction, using one of the following designators:

Checklist items:
- **Emergency:** There is a potential incident or crisis such that FedRAMP requires an extremely urgent reaction; emergency messages will contain aggressive timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes will result in corrective action.
- **Emergency Test:** FedRAMP requires an extremely urgent reaction to confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the FedRAMP Security Inbox; emergency test messages will contain aggressive timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes will result in corrective action.
- **Important:** There is an important issue that FedRAMP requires the cloud service provider to address; important messages will contain reasonable timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes may result in corrective action.

Terms: `FedRAMP Security Inbox`, `Incident`, `Provider`

Affects: FedRAMP

Note: Messages sent by FedRAMP without one of these designators are considered general communications and do not require an elevated reaction; these may be resolved in the normal course of business by the cloud service provider.

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `AFC-FRP-COR` MUST — Explain Corrective Actions

FedRAMP MUST clearly specify the corrective actions that will result from failure to complete the required actions in the body of messages that require an elevated reaction; such actions may vary from negative ratings in the FedRAMP Marketplace to suspension of FedRAMP Certification depending on the severity of the event.

Affects: FedRAMP

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `AFC-FRP-ERT` MUST — Elevated Reaction Timeframes

- **Class B:** by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 3rd business day

Terms: `Debilitating Customer Effect`, `FedRAMP Certified`, `Provider`

Affects: FedRAMP

Note: FedRAMP Class D Certified cloud service providers are expected to address Emergency messages (including tests) from FedRAMP with a reaction time appropriate to operating a service where failure to react rapidly might have a severe or debilitating customer effect on the U.S. Government; some Emergency messages may require faster reaction and all such messages should be addressed as quickly as possible.

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `AFC-FRP-PNT` MUST — Public Notice of Emergency Tests

### `AFC-FRP-RQA` MUST — Required Actions

FedRAMP MUST clearly specify the required actions in the body of messages that require an elevated reaction.

Affects: FedRAMP

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `AFC-FRP-UFS` MUST — Use FedRAMP_Security Email in Emergencies

FedRAMP MUST send Emergency and Emergency Test designated messages from fedramp_security@gsa.gov OR fedramp_security@fedramp.gov.

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `AFC-FRP-VRE` MUST — Verified Emails

FedRAMP MUST send messages to cloud service providers using an official @fedramp.gov or @gsa.gov email address with properly configured Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) email authentication.

Terms: `Provider`

Affects: FedRAMP

Note: Anyone at GSA can send email from @fedramp.gov or @gsa.gov - FedRAMP team members will typically have "FedRAMP" or "F20B" in their name but this is not universal or enforceable. The nature of government enterprise IT services makes it difficult for FedRAMP to isolate FedRAMP-specific team members with enforceable identifiers.
