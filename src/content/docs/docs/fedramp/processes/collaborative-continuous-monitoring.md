# Collaborative Continuous Monitoring

Short name: `CCM` · Process ID: `CCM` · Web slug: `collaborative-continuous-monitoring`

Applies to: `both`
Status: `stable`


Official page: [https://www.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/collaborative-continuous-monitoring/](https://www.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/collaborative-continuous-monitoring/)

## Effective Status

- 20x: required · Consolidated Rules for 2026 · obtain 2026-07-04 · grace through 2027-01-01
- Rev5: required · Consolidated Rules for 2026 · obtain 2027-01-01 · grace through 2027-10-01

These rules reduce unnecessary manual burden by encouraging automated monitoring and review while allowing each agency to make its own risk-based decisions about ongoing authorization.

### `CCM-AGM-ROR` MUST — Review Ongoing Reports

Affects: Providers

Note: This is intended to encourage sharing of information and decrease the burden on the cloud service provider - providing this summary will reduce duplicate questions from agencies and ensure FedRAMP has access to this information. It is generally in the provider's interest to update this addendum frequently throughout the quarter.

Affects: Providers

Recent update: 2026-06-24 — Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.

### `CCM-OCR-SOR` SHOULD — Spread Out Reports

Providers SHOULD establish a regular 3 month cycle for Ongoing Certification Reports that is spread out from the beginning, middle, or end of each quarter.

Terms: `Agency`, `Ongoing Certification`, `Provider`, `Regularly`

Affects: Providers

Note: This recommendation is intended to discourage hundreds of cloud service providers from releasing their Ongoing Certification Reports during the first or last week of each quarter because that is the easiest way for a single provider to track this deliverable; the result would overwhelm agencies with many cloud services. Widely used cloud service providers are encouraged to work with their customers to identify ideal timeframes for this cycle.
