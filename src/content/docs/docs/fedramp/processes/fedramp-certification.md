Affects: Providers

Note: Some of these specific FedRAMP rules may not have similar counterparts in external frameworks and providers will need to implement new processes to follow these rules.
In general, for each of these FedRAMP requirements, providers should include a sufficiently detailed summary that reviewers will not need to dig into the related security framework materials to understand the related decisions - just saying "see SOC 2 report" is not particularly helpful.
Information about how the provider addresses the included Key Security Indicators are required to receive a class A certification even if the provider intends to pursue a Rev 5 Program Certification path in the future.
